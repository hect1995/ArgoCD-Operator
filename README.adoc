This repository continues the demonstration done https://github.com/hect1995/h2o-ocp[here] about basic features and lifecycle of __operators__. More concretelly, the https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[ArgoCD]. Making use of the operator a Grafana instance will be deployed to plot specific metrics of ArgoCD. Moreover, it is showed how to use the Monitoring stack from OCP4 to send alerts.
 Finally it will be explained how to delete the project.

== Launch ArgoCD

=== Setup

The first step is to define the `OperatorGroup`, which selects target namespaces in which to generate required RBAC access for its member Operators, and a `Subscription` to subscribe a namespace to an Operator. +
The list of Operators available to the cluster from the OperatorHub can be found by:
[source, bash]
----
$ oc get packagemanifests -n openshift-marketplace
NAME                                                 CATALOG               AGE
fuse-console                                         Red Hat Operators     20h
percona-xtradb-cluster-operator-certified-rhmp       Red Hat Marketplace   20h
neuvector-community-operator                         Community Operators   20h
federatorai-certified                                Certified Operators   20h
apicast-operator                                     Red Hat Operators     20h
atlasmap-operator                                    Community Operators   20h
aws-event-sources-operator-certified                 Certified Operators   20h
aws-efs-operator                                     Community Operators   20h
k10-kasten-operator                                  Certified Operators   20h
...

$ oc get packagemanifests -n openshift-marketplace | grep argocd
argocd-operator-helm                                 Community Operators   37h
argocd-operator                                      Community Operators   37h

----
The second option is chosen. +

Before installing the operator we need to check what are the `Install Modes` available and the `CRDs` that will be generated: 

[source, bash]
----
$ oc describe packagemanifests argocd-operator -n openshift-marketplace
Name:         argocd-operator

        Type:       AllNamespaces
      ...             
----

An Operator is considered a member of an OperatorGroup if the following conditions are true:

* The Operator’s CSV exists in the same namespace as the OperatorGroup.

* The Operator’s CSV’s InstallModes support the set of namespaces targeted by the OperatorGroup.

In this case the `OperatorGroup` needs to be configured to target its own namespace.

=== Deploy the operator

The `deploy-setup.yaml` template creates the `OperatorGroup` to its own namespace and subscribes to the `argocd-operator` and `prometheus-operator`. The latter is required later on  for Grafana.

[source, bash]
----
OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=argocd-operator # Define the namespace
$ oc process -f templates/deploy-setup.yaml -p OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=${OPERATOR_NAMESPACE} | oc apply -f -
----

At this point, OLM is now aware of the selected Operator. A cluster service version (CSV) for the Operator should appear in the target namespace, and APIs provided by the Operator should be available for creation.
Let's check it:

[source, bash]
----
$ oc get crd -n ${OPERATOR_NAMESPACE}| grep "argo"
applications.argoproj.io                                          2021-04-27T07:12:22Z
applicationsets.argoproj.io                                       2021-04-28T07:51:44Z
appprojects.argoproj.io                                           2021-04-27T07:12:22Z
argocdexports.argoproj.io                                         2021-04-27T08:19:30Z
argocds.argoproj.io                                               2021-04-27T08:19:30Z
----

=== Deploy and expose an ArgoCD instance

Now, two CRs of kind `ArgoCD` and `Application` can be deployed into the namespace:

[source, bash]
----
$ oc process -f templates/deploy-app.yaml -p OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=${OPERATOR_NAMESPACE} | oc apply -f -
----

The `ArgoCD` CR will first create an ArgoCD cluster, then generates instances for Prometheus, Grafana and creates the route to access the Grafana dashboards.

[source, bash]
----
- apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
  kind: ArgoCD
  metadata:
    name: example-argocd
    labels:
      example: insights
  spec:
    grafana:
      enabled: true
      route:
        enabled: true
    ingress:
      enabled: true
    prometheus:
      enabled: true
    server:
      service:
        type: LoadBalancer
      route:
        enabled: true
      insecure: true
----

Finally, an application is deployed into ArgoCD cluster through the `Application` CR, which imports an application from a remote git repository.

By executing `oc get routes` we can copy the routes created and access the ArgoCD server, the Grafana dashboards or the application.

[source, bash]
----
$ oc get routes
NAME                     HOST/PORT                                                      PATH   SERVICES                 PORT       TERMINATION     WILDCARD
example-argocd-grafana   example-argocd-grafana-argocd.apps.apps.sandbox9.opentlc.com          example-argocd-grafana   http                       None
example-argocd-server    example-argocd-server-argocd.apps.apps.sandbox9.opentlc.com           example-argocd-server    http       edge/Redirect   None
spring-petclinic         spring-petclinic-argocd.apps.apps.sandbox9.opentlc.com                spring-petclinic         8080-tcp                   None

== Monitoring
A typical OpenShift monitoring stack includes Prometheus for monitoring both systems and services, and Grafana for analyzing and visualizing metrics.

Administrators are often looking to write custom queries and create custom dashboards in Grafana. However, Grafana instances provided with the monitoring stack (and its dashboards) are read-only. To solve this problem, we can use the community-powered Grafana operator provided by OperatorHub, which is launched by the `ÀrgoCD` CR. +
In order to access Grafana we need to extract the password from the secret `example-argocd-cluster`:

[source, bash]
----
$ kubectl -n argocd get secret example-argocd-cluster -o jsonpath='{.data.admin\.password}' | base64 -d
----

It allows to create your own dashboards but in this article I will just present the default __ArgoCD__ dashboard.

== Alert Manager

The Alertmanager manages incoming alerts; this includes silencing, inhibition, aggregation, and sending out notifications through methods such as email, PagerDuty, and HipChat. 

An implementation example through `email` is given in [templates/alertmanager/alertmanager.yaml](templates/alertmanager/alertmanager.yaml), with some missing data that needs to be adapted by you.

NOTE: You need to create an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en). To do that, go to **Account Settings -> Security -> Signing in to Google -> App password** (if you don’t see App password as an option, you probably haven’t set up 2-Step Verification and will need to do that first). Copy the newly-created password.

The Alertmanager configuration can be updated replacing the content of the alertmanager-main `Secret`.

[source, bash]
----
$ oc create secret generic alertmanager-main \
    --from-file=templates/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml \
        --dry-run -o=yaml -n openshift-monitoring |\
            oc replace secret --filename=- -n openshift-monitoring
----

Moreover, We can configure the Alertmanager through the Openshift 4 platform, in **Administration -> Cluster Settings -> Global configuration -> Alertmanager**

If everything works as expected the receiver should receive notifications like the following one:
